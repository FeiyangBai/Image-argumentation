# Image-argumentation
This code aims to help argument image data for a larger dataset for Machine Learning

The steps go as follows: 
1. Zip the image file and upload it to Colab
2. install the augmented library to define what argument image wanted, like zoom, flip, skew...
3. zip the argument file and download to the local computer

Hope this will help others! Enjoy learning!
